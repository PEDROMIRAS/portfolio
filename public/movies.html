    <h4>Transformers: The Last Knight</h4>
    <p>
        This is my favorite movie of all time. I love the action scenes and the special effects are amazing. 
        The story is also very interesting and keeps me on the edge of my seat.

    <h4>Pacific Rim</h4>
    <p>
        This movie is a close second to Transformers. I love the giant robots and the monsters. 
        The action scenes are also very well done and the story is very engaging.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Grown Ups</h4>
    <p>
        This movie is a comedy that I love to watch when I want to relax and have a good laugh. 
        The cast is amazing and the jokes are hilarious.
